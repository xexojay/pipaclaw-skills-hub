# pipaclaw-skills-hub

This directory is the public repository boundary for `pipaclaw-skills-hub`.

It should contain only publishable skill packages:

- `SKILL.md`
- `agents/`
- `references/`
- skill subdirectories such as `ppt-maker/`

It should not contain implementation-specific material:

- backend services
- local runtimes or exporters
- test scripts
- sample customer files
- private assets or reverse-engineered templates
- `node_modules`, build output, or generated artifacts

Current public skills:

- `social-account-ops`
- `ppt-maker`
- `promo-video-maker`

Repository layout:

```text

└── promo-video-maker/
```

Repository rule:

- social account operations are exposed through exactly one public skill: `social-account-ops`
- diagnosis, planning, writing, and retro are internal phases inside that one skill, not separate public packages

Recommended publish flow:

1. Treat this `skills/` directory as the GitHub repo root.
2. Keep execution backends in separate private or implementation repos.
3. Review each skill package for customer data, generated assets, and non-markdown implementation files before release.
4. Follow [PUBLISHING.md](/Users/xiexiongjie/code/skills-hub/skills/PUBLISHING.md) for login, version bumps, proxy handling, and ClawHub publish commands.
5. Use [bin/clawhub-release](/Users/xiexiongjie/code/skills-hub/skills/bin/clawhub-release) as the standard release entrypoint.
